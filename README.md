# Blosxom Plugin: wikieditish with version control

This is a version of the [wikieditish](http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/plugins/edit/wikieditish.htm) Blosxom plugin that has some rudimentary version control bolted on.

Every time a change is made, the plugin saves a copy of the current state of the post into a backup file. This file is over-written each time so you can only revert to the last saved version.

See [wikieditish.pod](wikieditish.pod) for more information.
