       Blosxom Plug-in: wikieditish

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       Edit a Blosxom blog wiki-style, from right in the browser.

IINNSSTTAALLLLAATTIIOONN AANNDD QQUUIICCKK SSTTAARRTT
       Drop this wikieditish plug-in file into your plug-ins directory
       (whatever you set as $$pplluuggiinn__ddiirr in blosxom.cgi).

       Wikieditish, being a well-behaved plug-in, won't do anything until you
       either set a password or turn off the password requirement (set
       $$rreeqquuiirree__ppaasssswwoorrdd == 00).

       Move the contents of the flavours folder included in this distribution
       into your Blosxom data directory (whatever you set as $$ddaattaaddiirr in
       blosxom.cgi).  Don't move the folder itself, only the files it
       contains!  If you don't have the the sample flavours handy, you can
       download them from:

       http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/downloads/plugins/wikieditish.zip

       Point your browser at one of your Blosxom entries, specifying the
       wikieditish flavour (e.g.
       http://localhost/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/path/to/a/post.wikieditish)

       Edit the entry, supply your password (if required -- the default), and
       hit the Save button to save your changes.

       You can just as easily create a new blog entry by pointing your browser
       at a non-existent filename, potentially on a non-existent path (e.g.
       http://localhost/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/path/to/a/nonexistent_post.wikieditish).
       Give the entry a title and body, supply your password (again, if
       required), and hit the Save button.  The wikieditish plug-in will
       create a new blog entry for you on your specified path, creating the
       supplied path's directory structure for you on the fly if necessary.

       Enjoy!

SSAAMMPPLLEE FFLLAAVVOOUURR TTEEMMPPLLAATTEESS
       I've made sample flavour templates available to you to help with any
       learning curve this plug-in might require.

       Take a gander at the source HTML for:

       +o   head.wiki, a basic head template -- nothing special.

       +o   story.wiki, a basic story template -- nothing special.

       +o   foot.wiki, a basic foot template just about like any other.  The
           big difference is the "edit this blog" form for editing the current
           blog entry or creating a fresh one.

       NOTE: The wikieditish plug-in requires the presence of a "plugin" form
       variable with the value set to "wikieditish"; this tells the plug-in
       that it should handle the incoming POSTing data rather than leaving it
       for another plug-in.

FFLLAAVVOOUURRIINNGG WWIIKKIIEEDDIITTIISSHH
       While there's not much in the way of template variables and the sample
       foot.wikieditish provides about everything you'll need, here's a list
       of variables and their purposes for your reference:

       +o   $$wwiikkiieeddiittiisshh::::ttiittllee and $$wwiikkiieeddiittiisshh::::bbooddyy prepopulate the form
           with the values from the existing blog entry file.

       +o   $$wwiikkiieeddiittiisshh::::ppaasssswwoorrdd is prepopulated with the password you just
           entered into and submitted in the "edit this blog" form or
           preferences stored in a 'wikieditish' cookie, if you've the cookie
           plug-in installed and enabled.

IINNVVIITTIINNGG CCOONNTTRRIIBBUUTTIIOONNSS
       The wikieditish plug-in serves dual purposes: as a browser-based editor
       for  your Blosxom blog and as a wiki-style community blog, allowing
       contributions by a particular group of bloggers (using a shared
       password) or passers-by  (without need of a password -- true Wiki-
       style).

       If you'd like to invite contribution, you can assocate  an "edit"
       button with each entry like so:

       <a href="$url$path/$fn.wikieditish">edit this blog</a>

PPRREESSEERRVVIINNGG LLAASSTT MMOODDIIFFIIEEDD DDAATTEE//TTIIMMEE OONN EEDDIITTEEDD EENNTTRRYY
       The wikieditish plug-in can attempt to maintain the last modified
       date/time stamp on any blog entry you're editing.  Otherwise, editing
       an entry will cause it to rise to the top of your blog like so much
       cream.

       I say "attempt" since this doesn't work on every operating system (it
       doesn't do any harm, though).

       To turn this feature on -- it's off by default -- set the
       $$pprreesseerrvvee__llaassttmmooddiiffiieedd variable to 1.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIINNGG BBYY PPAASSSSWWOORRDD
       By default, the wikieditish plug-in requires a password.  You'll need
       to set one before being able to edit anything.  Set the $$bblloogg__ppaasssswwoorrdd
       configuration variable to anything you wish (e.g.  my $$bblloogg__ppaasssswwoorrdd ==
       ''aabbcc112233'';;).  Just be sure to use something you'll remember and other's
       won't guess.

       You can disable password-protection if you wish, allowing passers-by to
       contribute to your blog, Wiki-style.  Be sure this is something you
       want to do.  It has some possible security implications, anyone being
       able to write to your server's hard drive, post to your public-facing
       blog, and edit (read: alter, spindle, contort) any blog postings.
       Those warning's out of the way, to turn off password-protection, set
       $require_password to 0.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIINNGG BBYY IIPP
       You can alternatively decide to restrict editing to a particular IP
       address or addresses -- those in your office, for example, or the
       machine actually running Blosxom (127.0.0.1).

       To do so, set $$rreessttrriicctt__bbyy__iipp to 1 (it's off, or 0, by default), and
       populate the @@iippss array with a list of approved IP addresses.  By
       default, this is set to "this machine", the machine running Blosxom;
       shorthand for "this machine" in IP-speak is 127.0.0.1.  The following
       example restricts editing to those coming from three IPs, including
       127.0.0.1:

         # Should editing this blog be restricted to a particular set of IPs?
         # 0 = no (default), 1 = yes
         $restrict_by_ip = 1;

         # To what IPs should editing this blog be restricted?
         @ips = qw/ 127.0.0.1 10.0.0.3 140.101.22.10/;

       Of course, you can use a combination of password-protection and IP
       restriction if you so wish.

VVEERRSSIIOONN CCOONNTTRROOLL
       This version of the wikieditish plugin includes rudimentary support for
       version control.  It is diabled by default, to activate this behaviour,
       set the variable $$vveerrssiioonn__ccoonnttrrooll to a non-zero value.

       Whenever you edit (or revert, for that matter) an entry, the plugin
       will save the existing version into a file in the same folder as the
       "live" post, but with the file extension you specify with the
       $$ssnnaappsshhoott__eexxtteennssiioonn variable.

       You can revert to a previous version by checking the box labelled
       "Disregard changes and revert to the last saved version".  The
       reversion is triggered when the  plugin sees a paramter of rreevveerrtt==yyeess.

       The wikieditish plug-in plays nicely with the wikiwordish plug-in
       [http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugins/text/wikiwordish.individual]
       for wiki-style linking action.  And for wiki-style markup, be sure to
       try the textile
       [http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugins/text/textile.individual]
       or tiki
       [http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugins/text/tiki.individual]
